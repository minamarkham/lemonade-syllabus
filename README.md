# #LemonadeSyllabus

Based on [http://www.candicebenbow.com/lemonadesyllabus/](http://www.candicebenbow.com/lemonadesyllabus/).

Full credit going to Professor Candice Benbow of Rutgers for starting [#LemonadeSyllabus](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LemonadeSyllabus?src=hash) and collecting and curating the recommendations.

All I've done is migrate her work over to a Github repo for my own tracking purposes.
