# #LemonadeSyllabus

Based on [http://www.candicebenbow.com/lemonadesyllabus/](http://www.candicebenbow.com/lemonadesyllabus/).

Full credit going to Professor Candice Benbow of Rutgers for starting [#LemonadeSyllabus](https://twitter.com/hashtag/LemonadeSyllabus?src=hash) and collecting and curating the recommendations.

All I've done is migrate her work over to a Github repo for my own tracking purposes.

## Thanks
Professor Benbow and all the phenomenal black women who contributed to this project. If you would like to show your gratitude to her, consider [making a donation](https://www.paypal.me/CandiceBenbow) via PayPal.
